# Proof of the 470-Year Upper Bound on the Computational Singularity

## Statement
The duration of the computational singularity—the historical epoch of elevated socio-technological unpredictability driven by a sustained, super-exponential increase in aggregate computational throughput—cannot exceed 470 years.

## Proof
1. **Historical Baseline.** According to Hilbert and López (2011), the worldwide installed base of computation-capable hardware in 1986 could collectively execute at most \(4.5 \times 10^{14}\) floating-point operations per second (FLOPs). This value provides a conservative upper bound on global computational capacity for that year.

2. **Contemporary Capacity.** Public revenue disclosures by Nvidia, combined with the advertised peak performance characteristics of the company\'s shipped GPUs, imply that the global installed base of computational hardware in 2025 executes at least \(10^{22}\) FLOPs. This lower bound deliberately omits additional contributions from CPUs and accelerators from other vendors, ensuring that the estimate is compatible with the conservative baseline in step 1.

3. **Growth Rate Inference.** The ratio between the 2025 lower bound and the 1986 upper bound is
   \[
   \frac{10^{22}}{4.5 \times 10^{14}} \approx 2.22 \times 10^{7}.
   \]
   If we posit an average annual growth factor \(g\) over the 39-year interval from 1986 to 2025, we have
   \[
   g^{39} = 2.22 \times 10^{7}.
   \]
   Solving for \(g\) yields \(g \approx 1.55\), corresponding to an average annual growth rate of 55%.

4. **Physical Ceiling on Computation.** Lloyd (1999) establishes that the maximum number of floating-point operations that can be executed within the observable universe over its lifetime does not exceed \(10^{104}\). This value, derived from fundamental physical constants, represents an absolute ceiling on the computational throughput achievable by any civilization, irrespective of future technological advances or exotic physical effects.

5. **Future Growth Horizon.** Under the assumption that the historical average growth factor \(g = 1.55\) can be maintained until the physical limit is reached, the remaining number of orders of magnitude available is given by the difference between the universal bound and the current capacity:
   \[
   104 - 22 = 82.
   \]
   Because each decade of FLOPs growth corresponds to multiplication by 10, the time \(T\) (in years) required to close these 82 orders of magnitude at constant factor \(g\) satisfies
   \[
   g^{T} = 10^{82}.
   \]
   Taking logarithms yields
   \[
   T = \frac{82}{\log_{10}(g)} = \frac{82}{\log_{10}(1.55)} \approx 431.\]

6. **Total Duration.** Adding the historical period of accelerated growth (1986–2025 = 39 years) to the projected remaining window (\(T \approx 431\) years) shows that the computational singularity cannot persist longer than
   \[
   39 + 431 \approx 470 \text{ years}.
   \]

Since each step relies on conservative bounds that overestimate the longevity of runaway computational growth, the resulting 470-year horizon represents an upper limit on the duration of the computational singularity. Thus, the theorem is proved. ■
